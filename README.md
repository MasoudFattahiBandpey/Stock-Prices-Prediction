# Stock Price Prediction with Pandas and Scikit-Learn

## Overview

This project focuses on predicting stock prices using the Pandas and Scikit-Learn libraries in Python. By analyzing historical stock data, the project aims to develop a machine learning model that can forecast stock price movements, particularly for Microsoft (MSFT).

## Features

- **Data Collection**: Retrieves historical stock prices from Yahoo Finance.
- **Data Exploration**: Visualizes and examines stock price data to identify trends and patterns.
- **Data Preparation**: Sets up the dataset for machine learning by creating target variables and predictors.
- **Model Training**: Uses a Random Forest Classifier to predict stock price movements.
- **Backtesting**: Implements a backtesting engine to evaluate the model's performance over historical data.
- **Precision Optimization**: Adjusts model parameters to improve the precision of predictions.
- **Feature Engineering**: Enhances model accuracy by adding new predictors such as rolling means and price ratios.

## Goals

- **Predict Stock Movements**: Forecast whether the stock price will increase or decrease.
- **Minimize Risk**: Focus on high precision to minimize losses from incorrect predictions.
- **Improve Accuracy**: Continuously refine the model by adding new features and adjusting parameters.

## Future Enhancements

- **Algorithm Optimization**: Experiment with different machine learning algorithms and fine-tune the existing model.
- **Additional Predictors**: Incorporate more features like economic indicators, intraday trading data, and significant company events.
- **Advanced Backtesting**: Implement more sophisticated backtesting methods to ensure robust model evaluation.

## Conclusion

This project serves as a practical example of applying machine learning techniques to real-world financial data. It aims to provide valuable insights and tools for stock price prediction, making it a useful addition to any data science portfolio.
